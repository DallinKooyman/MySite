          Since I like games so much I decieded to learn how to make them. I enrolled in an Unreal Engine 4 course that taught me how to 
          use blueprints, gamemodes, and C++ to create games. I also learned how to create characters, worlds, levels, movements, and game mechanics.
          <br>With this knowledge I became a Game Developer at BYU and worked on coding the game <i><u>Shepards</u></i> while also developing puzzles, balancing the enemy ai, and constructing the save file system.
